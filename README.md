# SUMMATIVE_AI_Group17_Kenya-Housing

House Price Prediction Model for Kenya
This project is a machine learning model that predicts house prices in Kenya based on various factors such as location, size, number of bedrooms, etc. The project merges two datasets and uses different techniques to clean and create the model. The model is deployed in Flask and hosted on Render.com.
